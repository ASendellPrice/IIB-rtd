Result Reporting
================

This section of an SOP is relevant to procedures that encompass the reporting of results to internal or external stakeholders. It should detail the responsibilities and procedures for how results are released, including by whom and to whom results can be reported. Clear guidance ensures that reporting is accurate, timely, and compliant with regulatory and organisational requirements.

This section of an SOP may include:

- **Responsibilities:**  
  Define who is authorised to release results (e.g. laboratory staff, clinical scientists, data analysts) and the intended recipients (e.g. clinicians, patients, regulatory bodies).

- **Reporting Procedures:**  
  Outline the steps for preparing, verifying, and releasing results, including required documentation, approval processes, and communication channels.

- **Alert/Critical Values:**  
  Specify how critical or alert values are identified, documented, and communicated promptly to responsible clinicians or stakeholders. Include escalation pathways and timeframes.

- **Laboratory Clinical Interpretation:**  
  Describe how results are interpreted in a clinical or analytical context, including guidance on providing explanatory notes, limitations, or recommendations alongside raw data.

- **Potential Sources of Variation:**  
  Highlight factors that may influence reported results (e.g. sample quality, instrument calibration, software version, operator variability) and how these are communicated to end users.

- **Confidentiality and Data Protection:**  
  Ensure that reporting complies with privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR, HIPAA) and organisational policies on secure handling of sensitive information.

- **Format of Reports:**  
  Define the standard format for reporting (e.g. electronic report, printed certificate, database entry) and any required metadata or identifiers.

- **Record Keeping:**  
  Document how reports are archived, versioned, and made available for audit or review.
