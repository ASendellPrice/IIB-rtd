Resources & Tools
========================================

This section should provide a comprehensive list of all resources and tools needed to carry out the procedure. For bioinformatics procedures this may include:

.. dropdown:: Hardware

   - Workstation or computer type
   - Minimum specifications (CPU, RAM, storage)
   - Servers or network drives used

.. dropdown:: Software

   - Name and version
   - Purpose in the workflow
   - Access method (SSH client, GUI, command-line)

.. dropdown:: Network / Server Access

   - Required internal or remote connections
   - Permissions or credentials needed
   - VPN or secure tunnel requirements

.. dropdown:: Reference Data / Databases

   - Database name and version/date
   - Access location or URL
   - Reason for selection (e.g., curated, gold-standard)

.. admonition:: Example: HIV antiviral resistance
    The following equipment, software, and reference data are required to perform this procedure:
    - **Computer hardware:** PC or equivalent workstation capable of accessing the sequence server.
    - **Software:** SSH client software such as PuTTY, MobaXterm, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for connecting to the laboratory’s sequence server.
    - **Network access:** Access to the laboratory’s network with the sequence server mapped as a network drive.
    - **Internet access:** Required to access the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (https://hivdb.stanford.edu/). This database is selected because it is the current internationally recognised gold standard for HIV drug resistance typing.
