Resources & Tools
========================================

This section should provide a comprehensive list of all resources and tools needed to carry out the procedure. For bioinformatics procedures this may include:

- **Hardware:** Type of workstation or computer and any minimum specifications. Include servers or network drives if used. 

- **Software:** Name, version, purpose in the workflow, and access method (e.g., SSH client, GUI, command-line). 

- **Network / Server Access:** Describe required connections and permissions for internal or remote servers. 

- **Reference Data / Databases:** Name, access location or URL, version/date, and reason for selection (e.g., gold-standard, curated). 



.. admonition:: Example: HIV antiviral resistance

   The following equipment, software, and reference data are required to perform this procedure:

   - **Computer hardware:** PC or equivalent workstation capable of accessing the sequence server.
   
   - **Software:** SSH client software such as PuTTY, MobaXterm, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for connecting to the laboratory’s sequence server.
   
   - **Network access:** Access to the laboratory’s network with the sequence server mapped as a network drive.
   
   - **Internet access:** Required to access the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (https://hivdb.stanford.edu/). This database is selected because it is the current internationally recognised gold standard for HIV drug resistance typing.
