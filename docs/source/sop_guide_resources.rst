Resources & Tools
=================

The 'Resources & Tools' section of an SOP should detail all resources and tools needed to carry out the procedure. Depending on the nature of the procedure, this may include:

- **Equipment:** Any hardware, instruments, or devices required to perform the procedure.

- **Software:** Any software applications, platforms, or tools necessary for the procedure.

- **Reference Data:** Any databases, reference genomes, or datasets required for analysis.

- **Access Requirements:** Any necessary permissions, accounts, or network access needed to use the resources.

- **Consumables:** Any reagents, kits, or materials required for the procedure (more relevant for lab-based SOPs).

         The following equipment, software, and reference data are required to perform this procedure:

         - **Computer hardware:** PC or equivalent workstation capable of accessing the sequence server.
   
         - **Software:** SSH client software such as PuTTY, MobaXterm, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for connecting to the laboratory’s sequence server.
   
         - **Network access:** Access to the laboratory’s network with the sequence server mapped as a network drive.
   
         - **Internet access:** Required to access the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (https://hivdb.stanford.edu/). This database is selected because it is the current internationally recognised gold standard for HIV drug resistance typing.
