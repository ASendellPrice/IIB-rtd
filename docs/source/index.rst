Welcome to the advISO SOP writing guidelines
============================================

The following pages provide comprehensive guidance on the creation and implemention of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that comply with ISO 15189 (medical laboratories) and ISO 17025 (testing and calibration laboratories). It is designed to support organisations in their journey towards ISO accreditation. 

By exploring the sections in the sidebar, you will learn how to:

   - Structure SOPs effectively
   - Define essential content requirements

A glossary of terms is also provided, offering definitions and bioinformatics-specific translations to facilitate clear communication and shared understanding between both wet lab and dry lab teams.

This documentation was developed as part of the Wellcome Trust–funded project: “ISO in a Box: Developing a framework to enable the development of end-to-end genomics-based ISO 15189 and ISO 17025 accredited services, anywhere in the world” (Grant Reference: 228162/Z/23/Z)
