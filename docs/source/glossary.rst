.. dropdown:: Acceptability criteria

   .. dropdown:: Wetlab definition

      Predefined specifications or limits used to determine whether a result, process, or product is considered fit for purpose. Must be documented before testing—for example, control values must fall within a certain range, and PCR efficiency must meet specified thresholds.

         “Acceptability criteria for the qPCR assay required that positive control Ct values fall within ±1.0 of the established mean and that the negative control showed no amplification before results were approved.”

   .. dropdown:: Bioinformatics translation

      Predefined quality control (QC) or performance thresholds applied to sequencing data and pipelines. Examples include minimum read quality (e.g., Phred ≥ 30), acceptable mapping/alignment rate (e.g., ≥ 90%), and validated benchmark performance (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, and PPV for variant calling). May also cover reproducibility and runtime expectations.

         “Acceptability criteria required that at least 90% of exome target bases achieved a minimum coverage of 20×.”
