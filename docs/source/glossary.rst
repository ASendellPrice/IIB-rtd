.. dropdown:: Acceptability criteria (Wetlab)

   **Wetlab**
   Predefined specifications or limits used to determine whether a result, process, or product is considered fit for purpose. Must be documented before testing, e.g., control values must fall within a certain range, PCR efficiency must meet specified thresholds.
   
   *Example usage: Acceptability criteria for the qPCR assay required that positive control Ct values fall within ±1.0 of the established mean and that the negative control showed no amplification before results were approved.*

   **Bioinformatics**
   Predefined quality control (QC) or performance thresholds applied to sequencing data and pipelines. Examples include minimum read quality (e.g., Phred ≥ 30), acceptable mapping/alignment rate (e.g., ≥ 90%), and validated benchmark performance (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, and PPV for variant calling). May also cover reproducibility and runtime expectations for bioinformatics workflows.
   
   *Example usage: Acceptability criteria required that at least 90% of exome target bases achieved a minimum coverage of 20×*
