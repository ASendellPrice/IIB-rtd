Glossary of ISO terms
=====================

Here you will find definitions for common ISO 15189-related terms.

.. dropdown:: 🧪 Acceptability criteria

   .. admonition:: **Definition**
      :class: tip

      Predefined specifications or limits used to determine whether a result, process, or product is considered fit for purpose. Must be documented before testing—for example, control values must fall within a certain range, and PCR efficiency must meet specified thresholds.

   .. admonition:: 💬 Example usage
      :class: note

      “Acceptability criteria for the qPCR assay required that positive control Ct values fall within ±1.0 of the established mean and that the negative control showed no amplification before results were approved.”

   .. dropdown:: 💻 Bioinformatics translation

      .. admonition:: **Definition**
         :class: tip

         Predefined quality control (QC) or performance thresholds applied to sequencing data and pipelines. Examples include minimum read quality (e.g., Phred ≥ 30), acceptable mapping/alignment rate (e.g., ≥ 90%), and validated benchmark performance (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, and PPV for variant calling). May also cover reproducibility and runtime expectations.

      .. admonition:: 💬 Example usage
         :class: note

         “Acceptability criteria required that at least 90% of exome target bases achieved a minimum coverage of 20×.”

.. dropdown:: 🧭 Metrological Traceability

   .. admonition:: **Definition**
      :class: tip

      In wet labs, metrological traceability is the gold standard for linking measurements (e.g., concentration) back to SI units through reference materials and calibrated instruments.

   .. admonition:: 💬 Example usage
      :class: note

      “Metrological traceability of viral load estimates was established using reference datasets linked to WHO international standards.”

   .. dropdown:: 💻 Bioinformatics translation

      .. admonition:: **Definition**
         :class: tip

         In bioinformatics, metrological traceability refers to linking computed or digital results (e.g., expression levels, variant frequencies) back to reference standards, validated datasets, or algorithms, with documented uncertainty, thereby anchoring digital outputs to real-world measurement systems.

      .. admonition:: 💬 Example usage
         :class: note

         “Variant allele frequencies in pathogen genomics were benchmarked against Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) reference datasets to establish metrological traceability of computational measurements.”
