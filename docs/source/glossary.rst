.. dropdown:: Acceptability criteria (Wetlab)

   **Wetlab**
   Predefined specifications or limits used to determine whether a result, process, or product is considered fit for purpose. Must be documented before testing, e.g., control values must fall within a certain range, PCR efficiency must meet specified thresholds.
   *Example usage: Acceptability criteria for the qPCR assay required that positive control Ct values fall within Â±1.0 of the established mean and that the negative control showed no amplification before results were approved.*
