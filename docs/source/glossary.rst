   .. admonition:: **💻 Bioinformatics translation**
      :class: tip

      In bioinformatics, clinical decision limits are predefined thresholds applied to computational results—such as variant allele frequencies, read depths, or genome assembly metrics—to guide reporting and clinical interpretation. Variants or signals below these limits are not reported because they cannot be reliably distinguished from errors or background noise.

      **Example usage:**
