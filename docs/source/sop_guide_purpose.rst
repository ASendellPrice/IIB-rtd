Purpose of the Procedure
========================

This section provides a clear and concise statement of why this procedure exists and its intended use within the laboratory or organisation. It should outline the specific goals and objectives that the procedure aims to achieve, as well as its relevance to the overall workflow or system. This helps contextualise the procedure for users, ensuring they understand its importance and how it fits into broader operational or clinical processes.

      **Purpose:**
      The purpose of this procedure is to assemble and analyse sequence data generated from next-generation sequencing (NGS) of HIV samples to produce high-quality consensus genomes from which antiviral resistance can be inferred. This procedure forms part of the HIV genomic testing workflow, following sequencing and preceding clinical reporting. 

      It defines a standardised bioinformatics workflow for the processing, assembly, and interpretation of HIV genomic data, ensuring accuracy, reproducibility, and clinical reliability in antiviral resistance prediction.

   .. tab-item:: Code update & review

      **Purpose:**
      Bioinformatics pipelines are composed of code (software), which will require updating over time as bugs are identified and fixed and new features are added. In the cases where this involves code being produced within the Luma Genomics Unit (LGU), this should be subject to a review before updates are pushed to production systems. This SOP covers the processes by which (a) proposals for changes are made, reviewed, and changes actioned; and (b) resulting changes are reviewed to ensure consistency and adherence to organisational policies and standards.
