Purpose of the Procedure
========================

The purpose of this section is to provide a clear and concise statement of why this procedure exists and its intended use within the laboratory or organisation. It should outline the specific goals and objectives that the procedure aims to achieve, as well as its relevance to the overall workflow or system in which it operates. This section helps to contextualise the procedure for users, ensuring they understand its importance and how it fits into broader operational or clinical processes.

.. admonition:: Example: HIV Antiviral Resistance Pipeline

   The purpose of this procedure is to assemble and analyse sequence data generated from next-generation sequencing (NGS) of HIV samples to produce high-quality consensus genomes from which antiviral resistance can be inferred. This procedure forms part of the HIV genomic testing workflow, following sequencing and preceding clinical reporting, and is essential for generating reliable antiviral resistance data. It defines a standardised bioinformatics workflow for the processing, assembly, and interpretation of HIV genomic data, ensuring accuracy, reproducibility, and clinical reliability in antiviral resistance prediction.
