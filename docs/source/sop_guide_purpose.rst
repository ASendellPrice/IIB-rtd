   :open:

   The purpose of this procedure is to assemble and analyse sequence data generated from next-generation sequencing (NGS) of HIV samples to produce high-quality consensus genomes from which antiviral resistance can be inferred. This procedure forms part of the HIV genomic testing workflow, following sequencing and preceding clinical reporting. 

   It defines a standardised bioinformatics workflow for the processing, assembly, and interpretation of HIV genomic data, ensuring accuracy, reproducibility, and clinical reliability in antiviral resistance prediction.
