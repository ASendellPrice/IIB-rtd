Scope
=====

.. important::
   This section is a fundamental building block of any SOP

The 'Scope' section of an SOP should define the boundaries of the :ref:`procedure <procedure>` i.e. what it covers, what it excludes, and who it applies to. It ensures that users understand the exact context and applicability of the procedure, helping to prevent misuse or misinterpretation.

Depending on the type of procedure being documented, the scope may include:

- *Types of data or samples:* The specific data formats, sample types, equipment, or materials the procedure is designed for.

- *Technologies and methods:* The platforms, tools, or methodologies the procedure applies to.

- *Personnel:* The roles or individuals authorised to perform or oversee the procedure.

- *Limitations:* Any exclusions, constraints, or unsupported scenarios users should be aware of.

   *Example SOP content for a bioinformatics pipeline for detecting HIV antiviral resistance*
   
   .. rubric:: Scope
   
   The scope of this SOP is limited to the bioinformatics analysis of HIV genomic data for the purpose of predicting antiviral resistance. It covers the computational analysis of paired-end FASTQ files generated by Illumina NextSeq sequencing (2×150 bp reads). Processes include sequence quality control, de novo assembly, polishing, genome annotation, and antiviral resistance scoring for clinical HIV samples.

   Wet-lab sample preparation and sequencing are outside the scope of this document. Sequences generated using Oxford Nanopore Technologies or PacBio are not included in this SOP; only Illumina-based sequencing data are covered.

   This SOP applies to trained bioinformatics personnel performing validated analyses within the clinical diagnostics service.
