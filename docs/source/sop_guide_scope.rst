Scope
=====

The :ref:`Scope <scope>` defines the boundaries of the :ref:`procedure <procedure>` — what it covers, what it excludes, and who it applies to. This section helps users understand the context, purpose, and applicability of the procedure, ensuring it is used appropriately and consistently.

The specific content of this section will vary depending on the procedure type. Below are examples for different categories.

         For SOPs related to bioinformatics pipelines or analyses, the scope should specify:

         - The organism, assay, or clinical context (e.g. HIV resistance, TB lineage typing)
         - Accepted data formats (e.g. FASTQ, BAM, VCF)
         - Sequencing platforms supported (e.g. Illumina, Oxford Nanopore)
         - Analytical steps included (e.g. QC, assembly, annotation, resistance scoring)
         - Exclusions (e.g. wet-lab preparation, unsupported platforms)
         - Intended users (e.g. trained analysts, clinical bioinformaticians)
            
      **Example scope content for a bioinformatics SOP for HIV genomic analysis:**

      The scope of this SOP is limited to the bioinformatics analysis of HIV genomic data for the purpose of predicting antiviral resistance. It covers the computational analysis of paired-end FASTQ files generated by Illumina NextSeq sequencing (2×150 bp reads). Processes include sequence quality control, de novo assembly, polishing, genome annotation, and antiviral resistance scoring for clinical HIV samples.
         
      Wet-lab sample preparation and sequencing are outside the scope of this document. Sequences generated using Oxford Nanopore Technologies or PacBio are not included in this SOP; only Illumina-based sequencing data are covered.
         
      This SOP applies to trained bioinformatics personnel performing validated analyses within the clinical diagnostics service.

      .. admonition:: Example scope content for a training SOP for bioinformatics personnel
         :class: hint

         Add hints on what to include in the scope for training procedure SOPs.
         
      Add example scope content for training procedure SOPs here.

   .. tab-item:: Code update & review

      .. admonition:: Example scope content for an SOP for code updates and review
         :class: hint

         Add hints on what to include in the scope for code update and review SOPs.
         
      This SOP is primarily concerned with ensuring that changes to software are authorised, moderated and reviewed to ensure consistency with organisational policies on coding style. The following related processes are covered by other SOPs and are not covered here: 

      - Validation and verification of software and pipelines
      - Development and tracking of coding competencies
