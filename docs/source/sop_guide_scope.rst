Scope
-----

The :ref:`Scope <scope>` defines the boundaries of the :ref:`procedure <procedure>` — what it covers, what it excludes, and who it applies to. This section ensures that users understand the exact context and applicability of the SOP, preventing misuse or misinterpretation. It should clearly specify the data types, sequencing platforms, and analytical :ref:`processes <process>`that are included, as well as any limitations or exclusions.

For bioinformatics SOPs, the scope may include details such as:

- **Assays or workflows covered:** Specify which assays, organisms, or sequencing workflows are addressed (e.g. HIV drug resistance pipeline, *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* lineage typing).

- **Data type and platform:** Define accepted data formats (e.g. FASTQ, BAM, VCF) and sequencing technologies (e.g. Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, PacBio).

- **Processes included:** Outline which analysis steps are covered (e.g. QC, mapping, variant calling, annotation, report generation).

- **Exclusions:** Explicitly state what is not included e.g. wet-lab preparation.

- **Intended users:** Identify the personnel authorised to perform the procedure.

- **System or context:** Note if the procedure forms part of a larger workflow (e.g. integrated within a national pathogen genomics service).

.. admonition:: Example: HIV Antiviral Resistance
    
    The scope of this SOP is limited to the bioinformatics analysis of HIV genomic data for the purpose of predicting antiviral resistance. It covers the computational analysis of paired-end FASTQ files generated by Illumina NextSeq sequencing (2×150 bp reads). Processes include sequence quality control, de novo assembly, polishing, genome annotation, and antiviral resistance scoring for clinical HIV samples.
    
    Wet-lab sample preparation and sequencing are outside the scope of this document. Sequences generated using Oxford Nanopore Technologies are not included in this SOP; only Illumina-based sequencing data are covered.
    
    This SOP applies to trained bioinformatics personnel performing validated analyses within the clinical diagnostics service.
