Responsibilities
----------------

This section defines the roles and responsibilities of personnel involved in executing, maintaining, and authorising the procedure. Responsibilities should be described using role titles (e.g. *Bioinformatician*, *Senior Scientist*) rather than individual names to ensure the SOP remains current even when staff change.

Clear role definition ensures accountability, maintains consistency in analysis and reporting, and supports traceability under ISO 15189 requirements.

What to Include:

- **Roles involved:** Identify all personnel responsible for performing, reviewing, or approving steps within the procedure.  
- **Responsibilities:** Describe the specific duties for each role (e.g. pipeline execution, QC review, result authorisation, system maintenance).  
- **Escalation or authorisation hierarchy:** Outline who reviews or signs off results, and who to escalate issues to in case of technical or analytical failure.  
- **Training requirements:** Specify where competency or authorisation to run the pipeline is dependent on training or documented sign-off.  

.. admonition:: Example: HIV Antiviral Resistance Pipeline
