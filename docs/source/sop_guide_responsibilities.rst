Roles & Responsibilities
----------------

The 'Roles & Responsibilities' section of an SOP outlines the specific duties and accountability of individuals or teams involved in the execution, oversight, and authorisation of the procedure. Role titles (e.g. Bioinformatician, Lab Technician, Quality Manager, Head of Laboratory) should be used rather than individual names to ensure the SOP remains current even when staff change.

Clear role definition ensures accountability, maintains consistency in analysis and reporting, and supports traceability under the requirements of ISO 15189 and ISO 17025.

What to Include:

- **Roles involved:** Identify all personnel or teams responsible for performing, reviewing, or approving steps within the procedure.
- **Responsibilities:** Describe the specific duties for each role (e.g. performing laboratory procedures, data processing, quality control, result authorisation, report authorisation).
