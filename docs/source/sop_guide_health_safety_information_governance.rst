Health, Safety, & Information Governance
========================================

The health, safety, and information governance section of an SOP should outline any health and safety considerations, as well as information governance requirements relevant to the procedure. This ensures compliance with institutional policies and legal regulations, safeguarding both personnel and data integrity.

Depending on the procedure, this section may include:

- **Health & Safety:** Any specific risks associated with the procedure, including safe handling of materials, equipment use, and emergency protocols. While bioinformatics procedures are generally low-risk, consider ergonomic factors and workstation safety.

- **Information Governance:** Data protection and confidentiality requirements, including compliance with relevant regulations (e.g. GDPR, HIPAA). Detail how sensitive data or patient identifiable information (PII) should be handled, stored, and shared, as well as any necessary access controls.

         **Health & Safety Considerations**

         This procedure is performed entirely using computer-based analysis. Use of Display Screen Equipment (DSE) should be risk-assessed, and the working environment should be evaluated in accordance with Occupational Health guidance. Users must ensure ergonomic workstation setup, appropriate seating, lighting, and screen positioning to minimise the risk of strain or injury. 
   
         All users must comply with organisational health and safety policies and report any hazards, near misses, or incidents through the appropriate channels.
   
         **Information Governance Requirements**
         
         Patient and sequencing data must be handled in accordance with Information Governance and Data Protection policies. Personally identifiable information (PII) must never be stored outside secure, access-controlled systems (e.g., LIMS). Data transfers must occur only via approved, encrypted connections, and users must ensure that all analysis systems and accounts are password-protected and access-controlled.
