Health, Safety, & Information Governance
========================================

This section outlines any health and safety considerations, as well as information governance requirements relevant to the procedure. This ensures compliance with institutional policies and legal regulations, safeguarding both personnel and data integrity.

For bioinformatics SOPs this section will typically be brief, but may include:

- **Health & Safety:** As bioinformatics work is generally computer-based, specific health and safety risks are minimal. However, this section should detail any relevant ergonomic considerations (e.g. workstation setup, breaks to prevent repetitive strain injury) or institutional policies on safe computer use.

- **Information Governance:** Detail any data protection and confidentiality requirements, including compliance with regulations (this will vary by country/institution, e.g. GDPR in Europe, HIPAA in the USA etc). Specify how sensitive data should be handled, stored, and shared, as well as any necessary access controls.

   This procedure is performed entirely using computer-based analysis. Use of Display Screen Equipment (DSE) should be risk-assessed, and the working environment should be evaluated in accordance with Occupational Health guidance. Users must ensure ergonomic workstation setup, appropriate seating, lighting, and screen positioning to minimise the risk of strain or injury. 
   
   All users must comply with organisational health and safety policies and report any hazards, near misses, or incidents through the appropriate channels.
   
   Patient and sequencing data must be handled in accordance with Information Governance and Data Protection policies. Personally identifiable information (PII) must never be stored outside secure, access-controlled systems (e.g., LIMS). Data transfers must occur only via approved, encrypted connections, and users must ensure that all analysis systems and accounts are password-protected and access-controlled.
