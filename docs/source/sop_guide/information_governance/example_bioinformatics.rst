**Information Governance**

Patient and sequencing data must be handled in accordance with Information Governance and Data Protection policies. Personally identifiable information (PII) must never be stored outside secure, access-controlled systems (e.g., LIMS). Data transfers must occur only via approved, encrypted connections, and users must ensure that all analysis systems and accounts are password-protected and access-controlled.
