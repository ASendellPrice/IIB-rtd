**Information Governance**

All information generated, accessed, or stored during the code review process must be managed in accordance with institutional Information Governance and Data Protection policies, and applicable legal and ethical requirements (e.g. GDPR in the UK/EU, HIPAA in the US).

  - **Data Protection & Privacy:** Code repositories must not contain personal or sensitive data unless explicitly authorised. Any incidental personal identifiers must be removed or anonymised before commit.  

  - **Confidentiality:** Access to repositories, merge requests, and review comments is restricted to authorised team members. Confidentiality must be maintained at all times, and information must not be shared outside approved channels.  

  - **Access Control:** All systems used for code review (e.g. GitLab, project servers) must be password-protected and access-controlled. Permissions are role‑based (Reporter, Developer, Reviewer, Team Leader) and managed by the Team Leader.  

  - **Retention & Disposal:** Code review records, including merge requests, comments, and approval logs, must be retained in the version control system for the duration specified by institutional policy.  

  - **Audit & Traceability:** All commits, merge requests, and review actions are automatically logged in GitLab, providing full traceability of changes and approvals. These logs must be preserved for audit and compliance purposes.
