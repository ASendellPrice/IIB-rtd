**Interferences & Limitations**

The pipeline is configured to produce sequence data that meets the minimum standards required for generating high‑quality assemblies, SNP calls, and other downstream analysis results. It has been deliberately designed to operate conservatively, reducing the risk of producing results from samples with insufficient coverage.

In addition to the QC metrics defined in this SOP, the pipeline generates a broader set of statistics as a by‑product of the software tools it employs. For example, FastQC produces a suite of quality metrics that, while potentially of interest, are not all relevant to the laboratory's workflows.

To ensure ongoing relevance and accuracy, summary statistics are reviewed annually. This review determines whether any of the additional metrics provide useful insights that could enhance the quality of results generated by the pipeline.
