This section is **not applicable** to the code update and review procedure. 

Unlike laboratory or analytical SOPs, code review does not involve control samples, detection limits, or external proficiency testing. Quality assurance for code changes is already addressed through peer review, version control practices, and testing steps described elsewhere in this SOP. Therefore, no additional Quality Control & Verification measures are required.
