**Quality Control & Verification**

**Control Samples**

Each library preparation run must include a no-template control (NTC) to monitor for contamination. Positive controls or samples with known characteristics (e.g., reference strains, known variants, resistance markers) should also be included as specified in workstream-specific SOPs to verify that the procedure consistently produces expected results. 

**Verification** 

The pipeline was validated using DNA extracted from all microorganisms supported by the laboratory (see validation document VA021). To ensure continued performance, this procedure must undergo verification whenever new batches of reagents, consumables, or kits are introduced, significant changes are made to equipment, or other factors arise that could affect performance.
