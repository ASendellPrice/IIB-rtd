**Verification & Quality Control**

The bioinformatics QC pipeline has been developed to ensure that data passed to downstream analyses is of sufficient quality to produce reliable results.

The pipeline was validated against a multi‑project dataset consisting of paired‑end sequencing reads generated from all microorganisms supported by the laboratory (see validation document VA043). To ensure continued performance, this dataset must be periodically processed through the pipeline (every 6-months). If the pipeline is updated, the validation dataset must be rerun before deploying the updated version into production.
