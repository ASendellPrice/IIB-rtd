**Definitions**

**Limited-cyle PCR:** A polymerase chain reaction using a reduced number of amplification cycles to minimise bias while amplifying sequencing libraries. 

**Transposome** 
A complex of transposase enzyme and adapter sequences used to simultaneously fragment DNA and add sequencing adapters. 

**Tagmentation** 
A process in which DNA is fragmented and tagged with adapter sequences in a single enzymatic step using a transposome.
