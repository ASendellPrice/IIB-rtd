A modular alternative to SOP writing
====================================

Defining a single SOP structure that will work well for all possible applications within a laboratory can be challenging, as SOPs detailing wet-lab procedures will have very different requirements and content compared to those describing bioinformatics workflows, training procedures, verification and validation processes, or the miriad of other processes that may require SOP documentation. Likewise, defining a universal SOP template that fits all organisations is impractical due to variations in organisational structure, regulatory environments, and specific operational needs.

Creating a one-size-fits-all SOP template would therefore lead to sections that are irrelevant or redundant for certain types of procedures, making the SOP cumbersome and difficult to use.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a modular approach to SOP writing (Figure 1). This approach recognises that while certain sections are universally applicable across most SOPs (e.g., Purpose, Scope, Responsibilities), other sections may only be relevant for specific types of procedures (e.g., Data Types for bioinformatics pipelines, Equipment & Reagents for laboratory protocols).

Each building block in the diagram represents a distinct section of an SOP. Some sections are fundamental and should be included in all SOPs, while others are optional and can be included based on the specific requirements of the procedure being documented.

Using these building blocks, organisations can tailor the SOP structure to suit the specific needs of each procedure while maintaining consistency in format and style across all SOPs. Users of our approach will need to select building block sections that are relevant to the procedure being documented. This provides for flexibility and adaptability, allowing organisations to create SOPs that are better fit for purpose.

On the basis of the modular SOP structure outlined above, we have developed detailed writing guidance for each building block section. Each section includes:

    - A description of the section’s purpose and importance.
    - Guidance on what content to include.
    - Example content for different types of procedures.
