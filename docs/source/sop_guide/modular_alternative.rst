A modular alternative to SOP writing
====================================

To overcome these challenges, we propose a modular approach to SOP writing. This approach recognises that while certain sections are universally applicable across most SOPs (e.g., Purpose, Scope, Responsibilities), other sections may only be relevant for specific types of procedures (e.g., Data Types for bioinformatics pipelines, Sample Preparation for laboratory protocols). 

The following diagram illustrates the modular structure of SOPs using this approach:

Each building block in the diagram represents a distinct section of an SOP. Some sections are fundamental and should be included in all SOPs, while others are optional and can be included based on the specific requirements of the procedure being documented.

Using these building blocks, organisations can tailor the SOP structure to suit the specific needs of each procedure while maintaining consistency in format and style across all SOPs. Users of our approach will need to select building block sections that are relevant to the procedure being documented. This provides for flexibility and adaptability, allowing organisations to create SOPs that are better fit for purpose.

SOP building block guidance & examples
--------------------------------------

On the basis of the modular SOP structure outlined above, we have developed detailed writing guidance for each building block section. Each section includes:

    - A description of the section’s purpose and importance.
    - Guidance on what content to include.
    - Example content for different types of procedures (e.g., bioinformatics pipelines, laboratory procedures, training protocols) as appropriate.
