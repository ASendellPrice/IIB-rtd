**Result Reporting & Authorisation**

**1. Result Reporting**

Reports generated by the bioinformatics QC pipeline (e.g., MultiQC and Centrifuge) are produced in HTML format and can be viewed using a standard web browser. Key sample statistics are extracted from these reports and entered into the laboratory’s sample tracking system. Each sample is categorised as either **QC PASS** or **QC FAIL** based on defined QC criteria.

**2. Authorisation**

Results generated by the pipeline are intended for internal use only. As such, formal authorisation of results is not required.
