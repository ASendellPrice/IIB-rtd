**Underlying Principles**

The Illumina DNA Prep Library Preparation Kit uses Bead-Linked Transposome Chemistry. Upon addition of genomic DNA to the Bead-Linked Transposomes (BLT) DNA-BLT complexes form whereby the BLT mediates the simultaneous fragmentation and addition of Illumina adapters. After the bead-bound transposomes become saturated with DNA no additional tagmentation can occur. This saturation-based normalisation process provides flexibility to use a wide DNA input range to generate normalised libraries of consistent tight fragment size distribution. Following tagmentation, a limited-cycle PCR then amplifies the DNA fragments, adding indexes and adapters for sequencing to the ends of each fragment.
