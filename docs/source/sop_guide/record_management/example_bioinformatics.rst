**Record Management**

For each sample included in a sequencing run, the bioinformatics QC pipeline automatically generates an entry in the AutoQC database. This database captures both run level and sample level QC metrics, along with each sample’s QC status (QC Pass or QC Fail) and its organism/workstream assignment (e.g. HIV, SARS CoV 2, TB, C. difficile etc.).

Initially, records are accessible only to bioinformaticians until authorised by the duty bioinformatician. During the authorisation process, duty bioinformaticians must document the reason for any samples failing QC.

Following authorisation, records are viewable to other users e.g. technical staff within the laboratory.
