**Procedure**

**1. Run Setup & Documentation**

**1.1 Run ID Formatting**

When preparing a sequencing run, a unique Run ID must be generated to ensure proper tracking and documentation.  

Format:  

``<Date>-<Workstream>-N<Number of samples>`` 

Example: 

If a library is prepared for 32 HIV samples, including a no-template control (NTC), on the 8th of March 2025, the Run ID is: ``2025-03-08-HIV-N32``.

**1.2 Index Set Selection**

Consult the UDI Indexing Log (SOP 084F2) to determine which index set (1–16) is required. Record the Run ID on the chosen index set within the index log.

**2. Plate Map & Sample Organisation**

For each sequencing run, a plate map must be generated to document sample placement. 

**Requirements:** 

    - Record the Run ID clearly at the top of the plate map. 

    - Assign each sample to a specific well position. 

    - Order samples sequentially, starting from A1 and continuing acoss each row. 

    - Place controls (including NTCs) in designated wells, typically at the end of the plate, to ensure consistent placement across runs. 

**File storage: **

Save a copy of the completed plate map in <<LOCATION>>, using the **Run ID** as the filename.

**3. Reagent Preperation**

Referring to Table 1 and BenchAid 085, prepare the following reagents:

    - BLT
    - TWB 
    - TB1 
    - TSB 
    - EPM  

Record reagent lot numbers and expiration dates of all reagents in the NGS reagent database [REF].
