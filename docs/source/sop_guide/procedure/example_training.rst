**Procedure — Tell, Show, Do, Apply Model**

**1. TELL — Base Knowledge / Preperation**

Trainer/Coordinator must ensure that trainees: 

    - Receive all required reading/viewing materials before training 

    - Understand the purpose and context of the procedure they will learn 

    - Review any relevant SOPs, manuals, policies, or background documentation 

    - Demonstrate awareness of responsibilities (e.g., preventative maintenance, data handling, environment preparation) where applicable 

Trainees build foundational understanding before hands-on training begins.

**2. SHOW — Trainer Demonstration**

Trainer: 

    - Demonstrates the complete procedure from start to finish 

    - Explains the rationale behind each step 

    - Highlights critical points, risks, and common troubleshooting issues 

    - Uses the relevant operational SOP (topic-specific) as the demonstration guide 

    - Demonstrates proper maintenance, environment setup, or preparatory actions as applicable 

The trainee observes, asks questions, and records notes.

**3. DO — Performance Under Supervision**

Trainee: 

    - Performs the demonstrated procedure under direct observation 

    - Follows all steps as shown in the SHOW stage 

    - Practices using tools, equipment, or systems relevant to the topic 

    - Performs any required maintenance tasks associated with the procedure 

Trainer: 

    - Observes the trainee’s performance 

    - Documents success or failure to meet criteria 

    - Provides feedback and corrective guidance 

    - Delivers remedial training if needed

**4. APPLY — Independent Competency Assessment**

Trainee: 

    - Performs the procedure independently, without supervision 

    - Produces outputs or results to be assessed against predefined criteria 

    - Demonstrates understanding of workflow logic, parameter choices, documentation, or safety steps (as applicable) 
     

Trainer: 

    - Reviews trainee outputs and evaluates competency 

    - Records success/failure on the Training Form or rubric 

    - Provides feedback and prescribes further practice if needed 

    - Reassesses until competency is achieved 


**5. Review, Attestation, and Close-Out**

    - Trainee signs the Training Form to attest that training was completed 

    - Trainer signs to verify performance 

    - QA Officer or Approver (if required) reviews the documentation 

    - Training Coordinator files all documents in the designated training records repository 

    - The Training Matrix is updated to reflect completed training
