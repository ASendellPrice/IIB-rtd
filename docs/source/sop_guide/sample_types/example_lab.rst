**Specimen Type & Test Selection**

This procedure is applicable to sequencing workflows using microbial DNA or cDNA generated from RNA, including but not limited to viral and bacterial samples, where the Illumina DNA Prep Library Preparation Kit has been validated for use. 

Selection of samples for library preparation must be performed in accordance with assay-specific criteria and laboratory testing policies. Only samples that meet defined quality and quantity requirements may be processed using this SOP.
