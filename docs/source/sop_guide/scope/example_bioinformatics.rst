*Example content from a bioinformatics SOP outlining the procedure for assessing the quality of Illumina sequencing data prior to downstream bioinformatics analyses.*

.. raw:: html <hr />

**Scope**

This SOP applies to the quality control of 150bp paired-end FASTQ files generated using Illumina sequencing instruments (e.g. MiSeq, NextSeq) for microbial datasets only.  This SOP does not cover:

- Quality control of non-microbial datasets;

- Sequencing performed using alternative read lengths, library preparation workflows or non-Illumina platforms (e.g. Pac-Bio or Oxford Nanopore); or

- Downstream bioinformatic analyses beyond the initial QC evaluation.
