**Scope**

This SOP applies to all staff involved with aspects of training (trainers and trainees) related to building, executing, and managing analysis workflows within the Galaxy platform. It covers the training and competency assessment process for navigating the Galaxy interface, selecting and configuring tools, creating and editing workflows, running workflows on provided datasets, and documenting workflow parameters and outputs. This SOP does not cover advanced Galaxy administration tasks such as server configuration, tool installation, user permission management, or development of custom tools. It also excludes downstream interpretation of scientific results beyond verifying workflow functionality. The procedures described herein apply to training activities conducted within the institution’s designated Galaxy environment and are intended for users with basic familiarity with biological data formats but no prior experience with workflow construction.
