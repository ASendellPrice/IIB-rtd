**Scope**

This SOP applies to the preparation of sequencing libraries using the Illumina DNA Prep Library Preparation Kit within the laboratory and covers the preparation of libraries from DNA (including cDNA generated from RNA) derived from microbial samples for sequencing on Illumina platforms. 

This SOP does not cover:

    - DNA extraction or other upstream sample processing steps. 
    - Library preparation for alternative sequencing platforms (e.g. Oxford Nanopore Technologies, PacBio). 
    - Library preparation using Illumina kits other than the Illumina DNA Prep Library Preparation Kit.
