.. rubric:: PURPOSE

Bioinformatics pipelines are composed of code (software), which will require updating over time as bugs are identified and fixed and new features are added. In the cases where this involves code being produced within the Luma Genomics Unit (LGU), this should be subject to a review before updates are pushed to production systems.

This SOP covers the processes by which (a) proposals for changes are made, reviewed, and changes actioned; and (b) resulting changes are reviewed to ensure consistency and adherence to organisational policies and standards.
