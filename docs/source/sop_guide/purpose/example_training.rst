**Purpose**

The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardised, organisation-wide procedure for planning, delivering, and documenting staff training activities within ISO-in-a-Box. The SOP defines the required steps for preparing training sessions, conducting structured skills transfer, supervising practice, and assessing competency using the *Tell–Show–Do–Apply* instructional model. 

This SOP ensures that all internal training regardless of topic, platform, or discipline is delivered in a consistent, quality-assured manner and that all training records and competency assessments meet ISO-aligned QMS requirements.
