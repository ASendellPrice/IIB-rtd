**Responsibilities**

Responsibilities for code review are distributed across the roles of Reporter, Developer, Reviewer, and Team Leader.  

- Reporters identify and document requirements for new or changed code.  
- Developers implement, test, and submit code changes following agreed standards.  
- Reviewers assess merge requests, highlight required and suggested improvements, and approve merges when criteria are met.  
- Team Leaders oversee prioritisation of issues, assignment of roles, and closure of non‑essential tasks.  

A detailed description of these responsibilities and the step‑by‑step actions required is provided in the :ref:`Procedure <procedure_code_review>` section of this SOP.
