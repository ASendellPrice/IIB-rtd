Cross-References
================

.. important::
   This section is a fundamental building block of any SOP

The 'Cross-References' section of an SOP should list other controlled documents that support or relate to the procedure. Cross-references ensure that users can easily identify associated SOPs, validation documents, and equipment instructions necessary for performing the procedure correctly.

Depending on the procedure, cross-references may include:

- **Associated SOPs:** Related procedures that describe upstream or downstream processes, such as wet-lab procedures or reporting workflows.

- **Validation and verification documents:** References to documents establishing the analytical performance, accuracy, and reproducibility of the pipeline or procedure.  

- **Equipment or instrument SOPs:** Instructions for using specific laboratory instruments or software platforms required for the procedure.

- **Guidelines and standards:** Relevant internal or external guidelines, such as laboratory standards, regulatory requirements, or best practice documents.

.. attention::
   If the organisation does not have an electronic document management system (eQMS), cross-references should include version numbers and revision dates to ensure users access the correct version.
