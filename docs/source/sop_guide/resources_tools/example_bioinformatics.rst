**Resources & Tools**

The following equipment and software are required to perform quality control of sequencing datasets:

**Hardware:**

  - PC or equivalent workstation capable of accessing the laboratory’s production server.

**Software:**
  
  - SSH client software (e.g. PuTTY, Windows Subsytem for Linux, MobaXterm, etc.) for connecting to the laboratory’s production server and datastore.

  - Production version of the QC pipeline installed and configured on the production server.

  - Web browser for accessing the AutoQC database (http://10.0.2.25/autoqc).

**Network access:** 

  - Access to the laboratory’s network with the sequencing server mapped as a network drive.

  - User account with adequate permissions to read/write sequencing data and QC outputs.

**Databases:**

  - Active user account on the AutoQC database, with bioinformatician-level authorisation to review QC metrics, record explanatory notes, and manage sample pass/fail status.
