Defining a universal SOP template?
==================================

Defining a single SOP structure that will work well for all possible applications within a clinical laboratory can be challenging, as SOPs detailing wet-lab procedures will have very different requirements and content compared to those describing bioinformatics workflows, training procedures, verification and validation processes, or the miriad of other processes that may require SOP documentation. Likewise, defining a universal SOP template that fits all organisations is impractical due to variations in organisational structure, regulatory environments, and specific operational needs.

Creating a one-size-fits-all SOP template would therefore lead to sections that are irrelevant or redundant for certain types of procedures, making the SOP cumbersome and difficult to use.
